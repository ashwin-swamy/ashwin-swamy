# Hi, I'm Ashwin Raghav Swamy.

I'm a data scientist with an interest in interpreting and then visualizing data for easier understanding. I like finding patterns and monitoring vast changes over time. I'm hoping to use these skills to help businesses find interesting patterns they can use to better their applications.
